Atonomi provides a universal trust environment to enable billions of IoT devices to have trusted
interoperability for data and commerce.
Atonomi registers the identity and reputation of devices on a blockchain-based immutable ledger.
Atonomi accomplishes this by working with device manufacturers and other stakeholders facilitating
an ecosystem of participants designed to maintain decentralized consensus for device identity and
reputation. Combining on-chain and off-chain resources, and built on the Ethereum blockchain,
Atonomi’s architecture is extensible by developers across IoT verticals (for example, industrial IoT,
healthcare, and smart cities) to help secure the vast realm of IoT devices ranging from healthcare and
home automation systems, to smart-city infrastructure, to industrial sensors and controllers.
This is required because vertically focused IoT companies are building diverse new applications for
both controlled and autonomous device-to-device interactions, but the attack surface represented by
billions of IoT devices—most of which are now unprotected or poorly protected—could enable hackers
and other bad actors to disrupt the services that are expected to control many aspects of our lives in the
coming years.
